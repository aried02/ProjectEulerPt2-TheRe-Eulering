## Project Euler Repo

This is my repository for keeping up with my project euler solutions. I am currently at ~90 problems solved as of writing this, but have unfortunately lost most of the solutions from pre-50 problems. Maybe I'll re-solve them one day who knows.

As of now, I am mainly gunning for the Top 1% achievement on projecteuler.com, which requires solving 112 problems (so around 20 more), but I am also trying to focus on making my solutions scalable whenever possible (i.e. problem asks for first 10,000, I try doing 100,000 and 1,000,000 as well), and ensuring most to all solutions can run in less than 10 seconds.

Pretty much all of my solutions are in python right now, but I am interested in learning some other functional/scripting languages and using them as well, as I know they can be powerful tools for these types of problems.
